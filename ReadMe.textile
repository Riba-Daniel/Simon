h1. (simple) Simon BDD framework

Simon is a BDD framework for testing apps on iOS simulators and devices. I've written it to be as simple to use and easy to add to your projects as possible. In fact, it's so simple that all you need to do is to write a story file, include a single line macro to run Simon, and then include another single line macro on each step implementation. 

Simon's documentation can be found at "my main site":http://drekka.github.com/simon including a "Quick Start Guide":http://drekka.github.com/simon/quickstart.html

Enjoy
