h1. Version 0.3.0   2013

* Total rethink and re-write of many core functions. Simon now works by looking for views and waiting for them to appear before applying taps and other actions. This is different to previous techniques.
* Separated search functions from action functions to simplify the interfaces.
* Removed all SI prefixes from macros as they where not necessary and made the resulting test code messy.
* Simplified and redesigned the DSL behind the macros and methods.

h1. Version 0.2.1 Nov 2012

* Updated with new dNodi that can handle multiple attributes on a node. Now using a totally refactored dNodi. 

h1. Version 0.2.0 Nov 2012

* Major new changes.
* Added Pieman command line driver class.
* Modified Simon so he starts up with a HTTP Server waiting for the Pieman to issue instructions.
* Whole new set of command line args.
* More unit tests.
* Refactored and rebuilt the project and how it is assembled in XCode.
* Lots of other changes.
* Added -report option which turns on the command line output in Simon. This is now off by default.

* Added the boolean property logActions to enabled/isable logging of actions to help debug.
* Modifed the startup so that the SIAppBackpack is automatically loaded when the runtime starts. This removes the need to manually inject it in the main.m file.
* Added a --autorun program argument which can be used to start the stories from running on startup. Otherwise a Ui is displayed.
* Changed startup so that instead of loading the UI by default, it now starts a HTTP server which waits for commands.
* Added isEmpty method to NSString+Simon category.
* Implemented better filtering function for the UI display.
* Seperated the UIAppBackpack into UI and Http versions.
* Now storing state in a separate class rather than in variables.

* Added a search bar to the story report.
* Added ability to rerun all tests and search test file names and titles.

* Added a macro: SIIsViewPresent.
* Renamed SITapControl to SITapView.
* Renamed SISWipeControl to SISWipeView.
* Modded SITapView to accept both a NSString *query and a UIView *view as a parameter and to return the view it tapped.

* Fixed issue where creating UITouch and UIEvents on a background thread would trigger a 0xbbadbeef crash.
* Refactored SIUIEventGenerator into an abstract class. 
* Updated logging of UI to include all windows being displayed. This now picks up the keyboard.
* Refactored event sending code and background sending detection. Now a lot simpler due to using blocks.
